                  Introduction to ES6

ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 is the 6th version of the ECMAScript programming language.
ECMAScript is the standardization of Javascript which was released in 2015,
and subsequently renamed as ECMAScript 2015.
ECMAScript and Javascript are both different in nature.



                  ECMAScript vs Javascript

ECMAScript: It is the specification defined in ECMA-262 for creating a general purpose scripting language.
In simple terms it is a standardization for creating a scripting language.It was introduced by Ecma International,
and is basically an implementation with which we learn how to create a scripting language. 
 
Javascript: A general purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
It is basically an implementation which tells us how to use a scripting language.

Javascript ES6 has been around for few years now, and it allows us to write code in a clever way which basically makes the code more modern and more readable.
It’s fair to say that with the use of ES6 features we write less and do more, hence the term ‘write less, do more’ definitely suits ES6. 
ES6 introduced several key features like const, let arrow functions, template literals, default parameters, and a lot more.
